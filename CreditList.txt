- Catter's code learn from a lot of similar projects, here is a list to show their credit.
- Part of them is modified by NicoMico to better meet user needs by user feedback.
- Catter's function is all designed from user feedback, NicoMico do nothing but turn their idea into code.

[Migoto IO]
Catter's Migoto IO is directly copied from DarkStarSword's 3DFixs repository and merge GIMI,SRMI,XXMI,ZZMI,HIMI's code together.
Most of their feature is deleted and modified to make better user experience for tool user.

[User Feedback]
Without user feedback the Catter won't be useful like it is.
Thanks for all user join development and send feedback and advice , issue etc.

[Mod Reverse To Model]
reverse_mod_manually.py and DBMT's reverse function huge thanks to:
(most of name is hidden to protect their safety in AGMG and other community
expect NicoMico who is the only public ProModder being banned and targeted at 2023)

@Unknown AGMG Modder (Ko) | (original reverse scripts publisher)
@Unknown AGMG Modder (Ko) | Technique support
@Unknown AGMG ProModder (Ko) | Auto reverse POC
@Unknown AGMG ProModders (Ru)| Switch Toggle Reverse Parsing POC / MMT C++ design
@Unknown AGMG ProModder | DataType POC
@Unknown AGMG ProModders | WWMI reverse scripts first publisher / POC.
@Unknown AGMG ProModder (Global) Directly read mod buf file and ini into blender plugin first publisher
@NicoMico (for learn, organize all reverse scripts 
and combine them to better use and open source 
and spread them everywhere for freedom spirit
even under the pressure of being targeted, monitored, death threat, and subjected to harsh treatment 
by the majority of AGMG personnel who benifit & make money from model/technique gatekeep)

without their help the reverse mod function will never be made and spread.
To pay the highest respect to their generosity, freedom spirit and selflessness!
